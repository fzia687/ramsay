    "### Insight 1: Focus on High-Cost DRGs for Resource Optimization\n",
    "Evidence: Our analysis identified the top DRGs (Diagnosis-Related Groups) by total charges, showing specific DRGs that accrue the highest costs, such as those requiring intensive care or complex surgical procedures. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rationale:\n",
    "- These high-cost DRGs often require more resources and longer hospital stays, indicating a significant impact on hospital operations.\n",
    "- By focusing on optimising resources for these specific DRGs, Ramsay can improve efficiency and potentially reduce costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Actionable Steps:\n",
    "- Resource Allocation: Prioritize resource allocation for these high-cost DRGs to ensure adequate staffing, equipment, and facilities.\n",
    "- Cost Management Programs: Implement cost management programs specifically tailored to these high-cost DRGs to monitor and control expenses effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insight 2: Enhanced Patient Care for Specific Demographics\n",
    "Evidence: Our percentile analysis of TotalCharges by PrincipalDiagnosis and Sex revealed notable differences in charges for specific demographics, pointing towards potential disparities in treatment costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rationale:\n",
    "- Understanding these differences can help identify areas where certain patient groups may need more targeted care or intervention.\n",
    "- Addressing these disparities can lead to more equitable healthcare delivery and improved patient outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Actionable Steps:\n",
    "- Targeted Care Programs: Develop targeted care programs for demographics showing higher costs, ensuring they receive the necessary attention and resources.\n",
    "- Patient Education and Support: Enhance education and support services for these patient groups to help them manage their conditions more effectively, potentially reducing the need for costly interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing these insights can help Ramsay streamline operations and provide more focused and equitable patient care, ultimately leading to better outcomes and operational efficiency."
